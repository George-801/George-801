### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm just an idiot who can use NodeJS to an acceptable-ish level and is unhelathily obsessed with web dev.

#### Current Projects:
- Discord Bots
  - [BotBiscuit](https://dev801.github.io/botbiscuit)
  - [Emoji Bot](https://dev801.github.io/emojibot)
- [Media Coalition](https://mediacoalition.github.io) (although it's kinda dead lol)
- [N7-Group Website](https://n7-group.github.io) (although i'm taking an unreasonably long time cause i have no design ideas)

#### Things I've worked on that could be worth checking out:
- [Neon V](https://dev801.github.io/NeonV) - my own version of [a project that I was kinda cool](https://neon-studios.github.io/NeonX)
